# 📆 17 August 2025 – Daily Dev Log

## ✅ What I Did Today:

- Moved into my new hostel in Pune and settled into a new environment.
- Resumed learning **HTML & CSS** via the freeCodeCamp [Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/).
- Completed the full module **“Learn CSS Variables by Building a City Skyline”**.
- Took intentional breaks to maintain mental balance (watched weekly One Piece episode, went for a walk).
- Finished the entire city skyline module by night — slower than expected, but steady.

## 🧪 Project Work:

A city skyline design built using **HTML** and **CSS variables**, demonstrating how to create scalable, maintainable CSS through custom properties.
