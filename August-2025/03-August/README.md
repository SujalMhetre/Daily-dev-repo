# 📅 Day 3 – 3rd August 2025

## 📘 Project  
**Non-Coding Day – Pune Trip & SBI Exam Prep**

## 🧠 What I Learned Today  
- Got a real taste of time and priority management while handling travel, personal errands, and ongoing goals.  
- Understood that discipline isn't about rigid routines but adapting without losing sight of your main mission.

## 🛠️ What I Did  
- 📍 Traveled to Pune.   
- 📚 Reviewed SBI PO Prelims topics lightly on the go (Reasoning + English).  
- 📝 Logged today’s non-dev progress here for habit consistency.

## 🧩 Problems Faced  
- Limited time and scattered focus due to travel and logistics.  
- Couldn't code or study deeply – but avoided slipping into excuse-mode.


## 💬 Quote of the Day
