## ðŸš¨ Streak Break: 9â€“11 August 2025 
From 9th August to 11th August 2025, I completely broke my daily update streak. I did not log any progress on these days in real time, and I am writing this retrospectively. The truth is, I let momentum slip and allowed non-coding tasks, distractions, and inertia to take priority. This log isnâ€™t to justify it â€” itâ€™s to acknowledge the gap, accept the missed opportunities, and move forward with renewed consistency.
## What i did on 10-August:
A day overshadowed by guilt for not updating my repo, yet I didnâ€™t act on it. While I had important discussions with my brother about my Pune shift and future plans, I let personal priorities take the driverâ€™s seat over disciplined progress. Dropped my brother off in Pune and came back to an empty, unproductive evening. Missed an opportunity to start a solid project or take even one meaningful step forward.
## Quote of the Day:
"Guilt is only useful if it drives action â€” otherwise, itâ€™s just another excuse."
