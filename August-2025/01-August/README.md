# 📅 Day 5 – August 1, 2025

## 📘 Project: Technical Documentation Page

## 🧠 What I Learned Today

- Spent over **4 hours** working on the Technical Documentation Page from freeCodeCamp.
- Faced layout issues: navbar height, spacing, and section alignment.
- Realized I lack a **problem-solving structure**, not just syntax knowledge.
- Watched late-night tutorials at **3 AM** to clarify concepts.

## 🛠️ What I Did

- Built the page layout using **HTML + CSS** with `flexbox`.
- Attempted to style the navbar and main content correctly.
- Used `vh`, `line-height`, and layout properties but couldn’t fix it fully.
- Took screenshots and asked for help when stuck.
- Logged failures and learnings for self-accountability.

## 🧩 Problems Faced

- Navbar didn’t stretch full height despite using `100vh`.
- List items in the navbar didn’t space properly.
- Got stuck debugging minor things for hours.
- Felt mentally exhausted and **confidence dropped** hard.

## 🔥 Plan for Tomorrow

- Break down the project into logical chunks.
- Focus on **wireframing and section flow** before coding.
- Use flex layout smartly, with parent-child roles clear.
- Finish the page and publish it with a clean, commented codebase.
- Keep README habit consistent, even when things go wrong.
