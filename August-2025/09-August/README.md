## ðŸš¨ Streak Break: 9â€“11 August 2025 
From 9th August to 11th August 2025, I completely broke my daily update streak. I did not log any progress on these days in real time, and I am writing this retrospectively. The truth is, I let momentum slip and allowed non-coding tasks, distractions, and inertia to take priority. This log isnâ€™t to justify it â€” itâ€™s to acknowledge the gap, accept the missed opportunities, and move forward with renewed consistency.
## What i did on 09-August:
Spent the day celebrating Raksha Bandhan with my family. My brother came home, and we had a meaningful conversation about my career plans, ambitions, and the steps I need to take moving forward. Later, we included my dad in the discussion, going over my thoughts and goals in detail. No other significant work or progress made on personal or technical projects â€” the day was fully dedicated to family and reflection.
