# 📅 Day: 7 August 2025

## 📘 Project:
Pune Setup — Hostel Hunt, Backup Plans & Clarity

## 🧠 What I Learned Today:
- The Pune housing scene is more about *what you can tolerate* than what you want.
- Having a backup (even if it's not ideal) can reduce mental pressure drastically.
- When your basics are figured out — stay, food, budget — your brain can finally focus on the real grind.

## 🛠️ What I Did:
- Spent a relaxed but steady-paced day — conserved energy.
- Went out in the evening for a final round of PG/hostel hunting.
- Gained a clear picture of realistic rental options and market pricing.
- Found a hostel near my college with — all necessities included. Might not be perfect, but it's a solid fallback.
- Made a rough but actionable plan to shift to Pune.
- Committed to begin the new journey no later than **15 August 2025**.

## 🧩 Problems Faced:
- Felt mentally pulled between “perfection” and “practicality.”
- Hostel options were either too expensive, too far, or too cramped — had to lower expectations.
- Planning without overthinking is still a work in progress.

## 🔥 Plan for Tomorrow:
- Travel back home (Daund) and mentally reset.
- Finalize the Pune move timeline and course start logistics.
- Sketch out a *no-bullshit grind schedule* — coding, projects, sleep, repeat.
- Reignite learning mode — HTML/CSS shouldn’t stay paused longer.
