# 📆 18 August 2025 – Daily Dev Log

## 🌅 Morning Win  
Woke up on time with a clear intention to own the day.  
Did not give in to laziness despite weekend vibes.  
Took charge of the day mentally – small win, big momentum.

## 📘 Project  
Responsive Web Design (freeCodeCamp)  
Discussions around Java Full Stack Course Strategy

## 🧠 What I Learned Today  
- Took a hard look at my timeline, priorities, and mental focus.  
- Understood that shifting to Java after completing RWD is completely fine.  
- Realized I need to go deep, not wide – so no need to force JS before Java if the course will cover it.  
- Learned that if the course starts from Frontend (HTML, CSS, JS) again, I can use that as revision + level up.

## 🛠️ What I Did  
- Had clear strategy talks around whether to pivot to Java now or post-RWD.  
- Evaluated how to sync self-learning with the upcoming Full Stack Java course.  
- Mentally committed to wrapping up HTML/CSS/RWD by 31st August.  
- Got clarity: If course starts FE (HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap), then I’ll continue JS learning alongside it.  
- If React starts early, I won’t panic—I'll just follow the class pace and reinforce on the side.

## 🧩 Problems Faced  
- Overthinking sequence of learning: Java vs JS vs React.  
- Worried about losing momentum in JS, but realized timing matters more than rigid order.  
- Dealing with some mental fatigue due to constant decision-switching.

## 🔥 Plan for Tomorrow  
- Get back on track with RWD Project #:Technical Documentaion.  
- Add a README with proper formatting.  
- Finish the tutorial+notes from yt.
- Don’t just learn—ship something. Push one project to GitHub.  
- Prep your system for Java Full Stack classes starting Aug 20.
