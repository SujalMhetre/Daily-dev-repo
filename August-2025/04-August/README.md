# 📅 Day: 4 August 2025

## 📘 Project:
Life Sync – SBI Exam, Reflection, and Dev Direction

## 🧠 What I Learned Today:
- Some days are made for pausing, not pushing.
- After a mentally draining exam, rest isn’t a luxury — it’s fuel.
- Sitting with your thoughts and music can do more for clarity than any tutorial.
- Found some solid resources that’ll add value to my Full Stack path — small steps still count.

## 🛠️ What I Did:
- Gave the **SBI PO Prelims exam** — done and dusted.
- Skipped meals all day, finally ate something after 5 PM.
- Crashed for a few hours — my body needed it.
- Listened to some **old-school tracks**, spent time in the balcony reflecting on life, goals, and where I’m headed.
- Discovered some **cool Full Stack dev resources** — started exploring them lightly.

## 🧩 Problems Faced:
- Zero coding — not because I didn’t want to, but because I physically and mentally couldn’t.
- Feeling a little out of rhythm, but that’s okay — I’ll bounce back.

## 🔥 Plan for Tomorrow:
- Head to **college** to get some paperwork sorted.
- Visit the **Full Stack course center**, clearly explain the tech stack I want to focus on.
- Ask if I can attend a **demo session** to get a feel for the teaching quality.
- If it feels right, ask about **batch start dates**.
- Later, scout for a **PG/hostel/room** nearby to settle long-term.
