# 📅 Day: 14 August 2025

## 📘 Project
Personal & Family Time

## 🧠 What I Learned Today
- Sometimes stepping away from the screen is necessary.
- Family time resets your mental energy better than any break.
- It’s okay to pause when life needs you elsewhere — as long as you return with purpose.

## 🛠️ What I Did
- Spent quality time with relatives and attended a family function.
- No technical progress, but maintained awareness of my long-term goals.

## 🧩 Problems Faced
- Slight guilt for not progressing on dev goals, but accepted it instead of resisting it.

## 🔥 Plan for Tomorrow
- Wrap up the function and start mentally prepping for the Pune move.
