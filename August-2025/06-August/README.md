# 📅 Day: 6 August 2025

## 📘 Project:
Profound Edutech – Demo Class & Clarity on Full Stack Journey

## 🧠 What I Learned Today:
- Got clarity on the **quality, structure, and scope** of the Full Stack Dev course at Profound Edutech.  
- Networking with peers gave me a **realistic perspective** on the class environment and outcomes.  
- Sometimes a single in-person session can **remove weeks of mental doubt**.  
- Final decisions need ground-level reality checks, not just online research.

## 🛠️ What I Did:
- Attended the **demo class** at Profound Edutech.  
- Got answers to all lingering questions about **course quality, credibility, and fit**.  
- **Made new contacts** with other students and exchanged insights.  
- Mentally finalized the next steps and **brainstormed relocation options** for Pune.  
- **Prepared to return home** to clearly explain my decision and future plan to my family.

## 🧩 Problems Faced:
- The Pune relocation puzzle is still partially open — needs better planning and budgeting.  
- Have to convince family without sounding idealistic — facts, structure, and clarity will matter.

## 🔥 Plan for Tomorrow:
- Travel back home or plan logistics to do so the day after.  
- Prepare a clear **vision + execution plan** to present to family: course roadmap, costs, living, and timeline.  
- Shortlist 2–3 **PG or hostel options** with pros/cons for smoother shift.
