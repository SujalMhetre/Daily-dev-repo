# 🗓️ Daily Dev Log — 31st July 2025

## 🔻 Status: Recovery Day

Today didn’t start strong. I let distractions take over and didn’t get meaningful work done during most of the day. I acknowledge that — no excuses. But I didn’t let the day end in failure.

## ✅ What I Did

- 📺 Watched and practiced one more level of the CSS tutorial (Apna College)
- 🧠 Planned my upcoming FCC project: Technical Documentation Page
- 🗓️ Created a task plan for tomorrow, adjusting priorities
- 📝 Reflected honestly and committed to not letting off-days become a habit

## ❌ What Went Wrong

- Wasted most of the day early on
- Failed to execute on my original plan
- Let procrastination win until late evening

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- One bad day doesn’t define my week — unless I let it
- Accountability and action are the only real way to bounce back
- Momentum can be rebuilt *anytime*, even late at night
