# Daily-dev-log
A daily log to track my progress as a developer, stay consistent, and keep my GitHub contributions active.

## Structure

Logs are organized by year and month:

- `July 2025/27-July`
- `August 2025/28-July`
- and so on...

I started my journey on **15th July** 2025, knowing almost nothing about coding.

By the end of this month, I've already begun my learning path through the **freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design** course. I've made solid progress in understanding **HTML** and **CSS**, though the course is still ongoing.

ðŸ•— I will log everything at the **end of each day** to track my progress.

## Start Date

July 27, 2025
